People are by nature social creatures.  These past few months of having to isolate and distance yourself from others has been extremely difficult, both physically and mentally.  In today’s world, communication and social contact are a huge part of daily life, larger than they have ever been before. This situation happened so quickly, and it may continue indefinitely. We believe that one can abide by the ‘new normal’ and still maintain social contact by using Vox of Life. 

In Latin, the word ‘vox’ means ‘voice’. Vox of Life strives to be the ‘voice’ that can be used to initiate, maintain and communicate with others in a safe, controlled environment by the use of  the Vox of Life app. The Vox of Life is an opportunity to socialize with others with the same interests, hobbies in you choose, or with someone else who may just need to talk and hear another human voice. 

## Inspiration
Vox of Life was inspired after noticing heavy the toll self-isolation was putting on the mental health of friends and closed ones. Social distancing and self-isolation don't have to mean loneliness and silence. VOL's on the mission to encourage people to have meaningful social interactions, while still practicing safe social distancing. We enable this by pairing different walks of life to each other through just a voice call and simply by the time they both are available.

## Built
To rapidly execute on this mission, the proof of concept initially was "pretotyped" with a combination of traditional software engineering frameworks (NodeJS/Nest) and even no-code tools (Zapier, Airtable, Wix). We used NestJS to build our matching algorithm and backend server, and used the no code tools to build our frontend. The first prototype was complete in the first half of a weekend, and the private beta started the very next day.  A lot was learned from our testers and the project went through multiple iterations over the course of the trial very quickly.

## Challenges
Initially, VOL calls only worked over the web on desktops. Multiple testers provided feedback to make it also accessible over their mobile devices. In less than a week's time, the testers were able to dial-in to their calls. 

## Future
### Nursing Homes
Build relations with nursing homes, to allow the isolated elders to have one on one calls with volunteers
### Slack 
Integration for Slack, where users can have spontaneous one on one interactions with in their existing communities
